    <h2>Collection and Use of PII</h2>

    <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of the types of PII we may collect and how we may use it.</p>

  <article class="static-page-section">
    <h2>How we collect and use information</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>When you register we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and credit card information (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”).</li>
      <li>We may use cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you will not be able to stay automatically logged in to the Services.</li>
    </ul>

  <article class="static-page-section">
    <h2>How we use your PII</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The PII we collect allows us to keep you posted on Arima’s latest Services and updates. Arima may share PII with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our Services.</li>
      <li>We also use PII to help us develop, deliver, and improve our Services.</li>
      <li>From time to time, we may use your PII to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by unregistering at info@arima.io.</li>
      <li>We may also use PII for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Arima’s Services and customer communications.</li>
    </ul>
  </article>

  <article class="static-page-section">
    <h2>Collection and Use of Non-PII</h2>

    <p>We also collect non-PII − data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-PII for any purpose. We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where the Services are used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our Services.</p>

    <p>If we do combine non-PII with PII the combined information will be treated as PII for as long as it remains combined.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="static-page-section">
    <h2>Protection of PII</h2>

    <p>Arima takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard your PII against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>

  <article class="static-page-section">
    <h2>Integrity and Retention of PII</h2>

    <p>We will retain your PII for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="static-page-section">
    <h2>Access to PII</h2>

    <p>For other PII, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to such PII so you can request that we correct or delete the PII we have about you. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made by contacting Arima at info@arima.io.</p>

    <h2>International Users</h2>

    <p>Information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy.

Your use of the Services followed by your submission of any PII represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
